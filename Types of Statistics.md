# Types of Statistics
Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types: 
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Inferential Statistics.

## Descriptive Statistics:
- Summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots).
- It provides simple numerical summaries and visualizations that help in understanding the data.
- It do not involve making inferences or generalizations beyond the data at hand.

Descriptive statistics can be categorized into three main types based on the number of variables being analyzed: 
  1. Univariate   : focuses on analyzing and summarizing the characteristics of a single variable at a time.
  2. Bivariate    : involves analyzing the relationship between two variables simultaneously.
  3. Multivariate : involves analyzing the relationships among three or more variables simultaneously.

## Inferential Statistics:
- Draws conclusions and makes predictions about populations based on sample data, using techniques like hypothesis testing, regression analysis, confidence intervals and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
- Sampling techniques are the methods used to select a subset of individuals or observations from the larger population. These techniques ensure that the sample is representative of the population, allowing for accurate and reliable inferences to be made.
  

These two types of statistics serve different purposes but are often used together in the process of data analysis. Descriptive statistics provide insights into the characteristics of the data, while inferential statistics enable us to make inferences and draw conclusions about populations based on sample data. Both are essential components of statistical analysis in various fields such as science, business, economics, and social sciences.
