# Probability 

Probability is a way to measure of the chance or likelihood of an event occurring. It's a tool we use to understand and quantify uncertainty.It is a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility (the event will not occur) and 1 indicates certainty (the event will occur).

Eg:
1. if you're flipping a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails. The probability of getting heads is 1 out of 2 (or 1/2), and the probability of getting tails is also 1 out of 2 (or 1/2).

2. if you're rolling a fair six-sided die, each face has an equal chance of landing face-up, so the probability of rolling any particular number (like a 3) is 1 out of 6 (or 1/6), since there are six possible outcomes.
 
In probability theory, an event is any outcome or set of outcomes of an experiment or random process. The probability of an event is denoted by P(E), where E is the event.

- **Experiment:** A repeatable procedure with a set of possible results.
- **Event:** One or more obervations of an experiment.

  ```
  Probability = Share of Success / Total No. of possible outcomes.
  ```

## Probability Principles
Probability principles are fundamental concepts that help us understand and quantify uncertainty in various situations. 
  - Exact outcome can't be predicted.
  - All the possible outcomes are known.
  - Equally like outcomes.
  - Repeatable under uniform conditions.

Some key probability principles include:
- **Sample Space:** Set of all possible outcomes of an experiment or random phenomenon. It represents all the different things that could happen.
- **Probability Rule:**
  1. Probability value of an event occuring will be between 0 and 1.
      ```
      0 =< P(E) =< 1 
      0 represents impossibility (the event will never occur)
      1 represents certainty (the event will always occur). 
      ```
  2. Sum of all the probability values should be **1**.
      ```
      P(H) + P(T) = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1

      P(H) = 1 - P(T)  ==> Rule of Subtraction.
      ```
- **Complement Rule**
- **General Addition Rule**
- **General Multiplication Rule**
- **Conditional Rule**
