# Range
- The range is a simple measure of variability that indicates the spread or extent of the data in a dataset. 
- Calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

Mathematically, the range R is given by:
```
R = Maximum value âˆ’ Minimum value
```

Consider an example
```
1,2,3,4,5
Range = 5-1 = 4
```

```
1,2,3,4,5,100
Range = 100 - 1 = 99
```
**Here, outlier affects the Range.**

## Summary
The range provides a quick and easy way to understand the spread of data, but it can be sensitive to outliers and may not provide a robust measure of variability when the dataset is large or skewed. Despite its limitations, the range is often used as a preliminary indicator of variability, especially when a quick assessment of the spread of data is required.
