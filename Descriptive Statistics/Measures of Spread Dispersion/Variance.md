# Variance
Variance is a measure of the dispersion or spread of a dataset around its mean. It quantifies how much the data points in a dataset differ from the mean on average. 

**In simpler terms,The average of the spread difference between each data point and the Mean**

Mathematically, variance ![image](https://github.com/sateeshfrnd/Statistics/assets/8160366/a5d85917-db15-4789-abd6-0e4318d0ce57) is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the dataset. For a dataset with n data points and mean μ, the variance is given by:

- μ is the mean of the dataset.
- ∑ denotes the summation over all data points.

Variance is widely used in statistics and data analysis to understand the variability within a dataset. However, because it is in squared units. This makes variance less intuitive for interpretation because it is not on the same scale as the original data. 

Therefore, the square root of the variance, known as the standard deviation. *By taking the square root, the standard deviation is in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable.* It represents the average distance of data points from the mean in the same units as the data.

While variance is mathematically useful and often used in statistical calculations, standard deviation is preferred for interpretation and communication of results because of its direct relationship with the original data's units. It provides a more meaningful measure of the spread of data and is easier to understand for non-statisticians.
