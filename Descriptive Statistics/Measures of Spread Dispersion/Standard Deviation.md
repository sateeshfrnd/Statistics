# Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset. It represents the average distance of data points from the mean of the dataset and is often used as a measure of the spread or variability of the data.

Standard Deviation σ is calculated as the square root of the variance. For a dataset with n data points and mean μ, the standard deviation is

**In simpler terms, the standard deviation measures how spread out the data points are from the mean.** 


A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the data, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean.
