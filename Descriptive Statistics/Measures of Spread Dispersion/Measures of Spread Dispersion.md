# Measures of Spread/Dispersion

Measures of central tendency like the mean, median, and mode alone cannot fully describe a dataset because:
- They may be influenced by skewed distributions, outliers, or multimodal distributions.
- They don't provide information about the variability or spread of the data.
  
To gain a complete understanding, it's essential to complement them with measures of Spread/Dispersion.

Measures of spread, also known as measures of dispersion, variability, or spread, provide insights into the extent to which data points in a dataset deviate from the central tendency. These measures help to understand the distribution and variability of data points, complementing measures of central tendency like the mean, median, and mode.

## Common measures of Spread include:

- **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
- **Percentiles**: Dividing the data into hundred equal parts, providing information on how data is spread across different percentiles.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The range between the 25th and 75th percentiles, capturing the middle 50% of the data.
- **Variance**: The average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, indicating the average deviation of data points from the mean.

These measures help to understand the distribution of data points and assess the variability or spread of the dataset, providing valuable insights into the characteristics of the data beyond just its central tendency.
