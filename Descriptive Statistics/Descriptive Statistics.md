# Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It involves methods for organizing, presenting, and analyzing data to gain insights into its characteristics. 

Descriptive statistics provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset, allowing researchers and analysts to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships.

Key aspects of Descriptive Statistics
1. Measures of Central Tendency
2. Measures of Spread Dispersion
3. Measures of Symmetricity

## Measures of Central Tendency
Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that represent the central or typical value of a dataset. They provide insights into where the data cluster around and are used to summarize the central position of the distribution. 

The three most common measures of central tendency are:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

## Measures of Spread Dispersion
Measures of spread, also known as measures of dispersion, quantify the variability or spread of data points around the central tendency. They provide insights into how the data is distributed and how much it deviates from the central value.

Some of the common measures of spread are:
1. Range
2. Percentage/Percentile
3. Quartile
4. Mean Deviation
5. Variance
6. Standard Deviation
7. Interquartile Range (IQR)

## Measures of Symmetricity
Measures of symmetry quantify the degree to which a distribution is symmetric or asymmetric. They provide insights into the shape of the distribution and whether it is balanced around its central tendency. 

There are two common measures of symmetry:
1. Skewness
2. Kurtosis

## In summary
Overall, descriptive statistics play a crucial role in exploratory data analysis and provide the foundation for further statistical analysis and inference. They help researchers and analysts understand the characteristics of the data, formulate hypotheses, and make informed decisions based on the findings.
