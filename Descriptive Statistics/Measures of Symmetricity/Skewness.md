# Skewness
Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a dataset. It indicates whether the data is symmetrically distributed or if it tends to lean to one side.

Imagine a histogram or a line graph representing the data: if it slopes more to the right, it's right-skewed; if it slopes more to the left, it's left-skewed. Skewness helps us understand the shape and balance of the data distribution.

## No skewness
If the distribution is symmetric, it means it's evenly balanced around its central point, and the skewness is close to zero.

**(Mean = Median = Mode)**

## Positive skewness (right-skewed)
It indicates that the tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or stretched out, meaning there are some high values that pull the mean to the right. 

**(Mean >= Median >= Mode)**

Example:
- Distribution of marks in difficult Exam.
- Distribution of salary in a company.  

Outliers can contribute to positive skewness in a dataset because they pull the mean of the data towards the direction of their extreme values.

### Example, 
#### Distribution of students age
consider a dataset representing the ages of students in a class. Most students may be between 18 and 22 years old, but there might be a few older students who are outliers, say 30 years old or above. These outliers, being significantly older than the majority of students, would pull the mean age towards the higher end, resulting in a right-skewed distribution.

#### Distribution of companies profits
Similarly, in financial data, if a dataset represents the profits of companies, most companies may have moderate profits, but there could be a few companies with exceptionally high profits (outliers). These high-profit outliers would cause the distribution to be right-skewed because they contribute to a longer right tail.

*In summary, outliers with values larger than the majority of the data points can cause positive skewness by stretching the distribution towards the right side.*

## Negative skewness (left-skewed)
It indicates that the tail on the left side of the distribution is longer, implying there are some low values that pull the mean to the left.

**(Mode >= Median >= Mean)**

### Example
- Distribution Death Rates :- Death Rate is high after age 50
- Distribution of marks in easy exam :- very few students will fail
- Wealth distibution of the country :- very few people having good wealth.
