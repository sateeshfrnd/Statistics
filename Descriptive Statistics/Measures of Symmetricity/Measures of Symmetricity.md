# Measures of Symmetricity
Measures of symmetry assess the balance or asymmetry of a distribution around its central point. 

*In simple terms, measures of symmetry help us understand whether a dataset is balanced or skewed*

There are several statistical measures used to quantify symmetry in a dataset:

**Skewness**: Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution in terms of its tails. Think of skewness as describing the shape of a distribution. If it's perfectly symmetrical, it's like a mirror image on both sides. But if one side of the distribution is stretched out more than the other, we say it's skewed. For example, if most values are concentrated on the left and there are a few really large values on the right, it's right-skewed. If it's the opposite, with most values on the right and a few really small values on the left, it's left-skewed.

**Kurtosis**: This tells us how peaked or flat the distribution is. Imagine a histogram of the data: if it's tall and narrow in the middle with steep edges (like a mountain peak), it has high kurtosis. If it's flatter in the middle and has more spread-out tails (like a plateau), it has low kurtosis.

**Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: This measures the relative variability of the data. If the CV is low, it means the data points are close to the mean, so there's not much variability. But if it's high, it means the data points are more spread out from the mean, indicating greater variability.

These measures provide insights into the shape and characteristics of the distribution, helping to understand the degree of symmetry or asymmetry present in the dataset.
