# Measures of Central Tendency
Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that represent the central or typical value of a dataset. They provide insights into where the data cluster around and are used to summarize the central position of the distribution. The three most common measures of central tendency are:

1. **Mean**:
   - The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of observations.
   - It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and can be affected by skewed distributions.
   - Formula:

represents each individual value in the dataset and *n*  is the number of observations.

2. **Median**:
   - The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending order.
   - It is not affected by extreme values (outliers) and is often preferred when the data are skewed.
   - If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. If it has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.
   
3. **Mode**:
   - The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.
   - A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal).
   - The mode can be useful for categorical data or when identifying the most common category in a frequency distribution.

These measures provide different perspectives on the central tendency of a dataset and are used depending on the nature of the data and the specific goals of the analysis.
