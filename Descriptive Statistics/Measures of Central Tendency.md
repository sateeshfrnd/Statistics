# Measures of Central Tendency
Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that represent the central or typical value of a dataset. They provide insights into where the data cluster around and are used to summarize the central position of the distribution. 

The three most common measures of central tendency are:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode


## Mean (Arithmatic Mid value of data)
   - The mean, also known as the population mean or μ (mu), represents the average value of a variable in an entire population.
   - It is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset/population and dividing by the number of values.
   - It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and can be affected by skewed distributions.
   - Formula for the population mean is:

### Sample Mean
- The sample mean represents the average value of a variable in a sample of data drawn from a larger population.
- It is calculated in a similar manner to the population mean, but it uses the data from the sample rather than the entire population.
- Formula for the sample mean is

### Population Mean VS Sample Mean
- The population mean describes the average value of an entire population, whereas the sample mean describes the average value of a sample drawn from that population.
- The population mean is a fixed value that represents the true average of the population, while the sample mean can vary from one sample to another.
- When calculating the sample mean, we typically use the symbol ![image](https://github.com/sateeshfrnd/Statistics/assets/8160366/0223cf8b-0520-44f9-92f1-1b64a5ac229e)  to distinguish it from the population mean *μ*.

In summary, the mean and sample mean both provide measures of central tendency, but they apply to different contexts: the entire population and a sample drawn from that population, respectively.

## Median
   - The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending order.
   - It is not affected by extreme values (outliers) and is often preferred when the data are skewed.
   - If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. If it has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.
   
## Mode
   - The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset.
   - A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal).
   - The mode can be useful for categorical data or when identifying the most common category in a frequency distribution.

These measures provide different perspectives on the central tendency of a dataset and are used depending on the nature of the data and the specific goals of the analysis.
