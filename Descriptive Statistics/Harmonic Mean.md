# Harmonic Mean

The harmonic mean is another type of average, similar to the arithmetic and geometric means. It is especially useful when *dealing with rates or ratios*.

The harmonic mean is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the values.

Where:
- H is the harmonic mean.
- n is the number of values.

## Characteristics
- Harmonic Mean plays a pivotal role in the F1-score, which combines precision and recall to provide a balanced measure of classification model performance.
- It suitable for situations with reciprocal relationships between variables.
- Commonly used to calculate average rates, such as average speed or fuel efficiency, where the impact of individual values on the overall rate needs to be balanced.
- Less affected by outliers compared to the arithmetic mean, making it more robust in the presence of extreme values.
- The harmonic mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean and approaches the value of the smallest data point as the number of values increases.
