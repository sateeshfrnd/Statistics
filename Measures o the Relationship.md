# Measures of the Relationship 
Measures of the relationship between variables quantify the degree and nature of their association or dependency. They help understand how changes in one variable relate to changes in another.

Common measures include 
1. Covariance
2. Correlation

## Covariance
- Covariance measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- It indicates whether the variables change together and in which direction.
- A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together.
- A negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase as the other decreases.
- Covariance ranges from -∞ to ∞,
- However, the magnitude of covariance is not standardized and depends on the units of the variables and making it difficult to interpret and compare.

## Correlation
- Correlation coefficient provides a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- Unlike covariance, correlation is standardized and ranges from -1 to 1, where:
  - 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship
  - −1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship
  - 0 indicates no linear relationship.
- Correlation is less affected by the scale of the variables compared to covariance.

In summary, covariance and correlation both measure the relationship between two variables, but correlation provides a standardized measure that is easier to interpret and compare across different datasets. Correlation is widely used in practice due to its simplicity and robustness.
