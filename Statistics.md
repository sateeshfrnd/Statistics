# Statistics
Statistics is a part of mathematics which deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing numerical data. It provides methods and techniques for summarizing, describing and analysing data in such a way that meaningful conclusions can be drawn from data.

## Types of Statistics
Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types: 
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Inferential Statistics.

## Descriptive Statistics:
- Summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and graphical representations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots).
- It provides simple numerical summaries and visualizations that help in understanding the data.
- It do not involve making inferences or generalizations beyond the data at hand.

Descriptive statistics can be categorized into three main types based on the number of variables being analyzed: 
  1. Univariate   : focuses on analyzing and summarizing the characteristics of a single variable at a time.
  2. Bivariate    : involves analyzing the relationship between two variables simultaneously.
  3. Multivariate : involves analyzing the relationships among three or more variables simultaneously.

## Inferential Statistics:
- Draws conclusions and makes predictions about populations based on sample data, using techniques like hypothesis testing, regression analysis, confidence intervals and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
- Sampling techniques are the methods used to select a subset of individuals or observations from the larger population. These techniques ensure that the sample is representative of the population, allowing for accurate and reliable inferences to be made.

*Z-test, t-test, F-test, and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)* are statistical tests used for hypothesis testing and comparing means or variances in datasets. 

These two types of statistics serve different purposes but are often used together in the process of data analysis. Descriptive statistics provide insights into the characteristics of the data, while inferential statistics enable us to make inferences and draw conclusions about populations based on sample data. Both are essential components of statistical analysis in various fields such as science, business, economics, and social sciences.

## Data
In Statistics, 'data' refers to the information or observations that are collected, analyzed, and interpreted to gain insights into a particular phenomenon. Data can take various forms depending on the context and the nature of the study.

And Data can broadly be categorized into two main types: 
1. Quantitative Data (Numerical Data)
    - **Discrete Data**: Countable, consists of distinct values, often whole numbers, with gaps between them (e.g., number of students in a class, counts of items in a store inventory).
    - **Continuous Data**: Measurable, can take any value within a range, often represented by real numbers, without gaps or interruptions (e.g., height, weight, temperature).
    Discrete data are like "counting" while continuous data are like "measuring." They have different characteristics and may require different statistical techniques for analysis.

2. Qualitative Data  (Categorical Data)
  - **Nominal Data**: Categories with no inherent order or ranking, purely labels or names (e.g., colors, gender, types of fruit). Nominal data can be counted and categorized but cannot be ordered.
  - **Ordinal Data**: Categories with a natural order or ranking, where the intervals between categories may not be uniform (e.g., education level, Likert scale ratings). Ordinal data can be ordered or ranked, but the differences between categories may not be consistent.
  Nominal data are like "naming" while ordinal data are like "ranking." They both represent categorical information, but ordinal data have an inherent order or ranking that nominal data lack.

Quantitative data are often analyzed using statistical tools that are designed for numerical values, while qualitative data may require different approaches such as frequency distributions, contingency tables, or chi-square tests. Both quantitative and qualitative data play important roles in research and analysis, and the choice between them depends on the research objectives, study design, and nature of the variables being studied.
