# Normal Distribution

The Normal Distribution, also known as the *Gaussian distribution*, is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics. *It is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric, bell-shaped, and characterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).*

Most of the naturally occuring/human generated follows Normal Distribution.
The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution forms a smooth, bell-shaped curve when plotted. The highest point of the curve corresponds to the mean (μ).

The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is :

where:
- x is a random variable
- μ is the mean
- σ is the standard deviation
- e is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)
- π is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159)

## Characteristics 
Key Characteristics of the Normal Distribution:
- **Symmetric:** Distribution is symmetric around its mean (μ), that means that the probabilities of the data points to the lefte and right mean are equal.
- **Skewness :** There is no skewness because the distribution is perfectly symmetrical.
- **Kurtosis :** 
  - For a normal distribution, the fourth moment about the mean is equal to 3 times the square of the standard deviation (σ4),resulting in a kurtosis value of 3.
  -  the excess kurtosis is calculated by subtracting 3 from this value, resulting in an excess kurtosis of 0 for a normal distribution. This is why it's often said that the kurtosis value of a normal distribution is 3.
-  **Mean,Median,Mode are equal:** Distribution is symmetric, so mean, median, and mode are all equal.
-  **Empirical Rule:** The empirical rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule, states that for a normal distribution:
    - About 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (σ) of the mean (μ).
    - About 95% falls within two standard deviations (2σ) of the mean.
    - About 99.7% falls within three standard deviations (3σ) of the mean.

Due to its mathematical properties and its ability to model many natural phenomena. It is often used in *statistical inference like identify outlier, hypothesis testing, and modeling real-world data*.
