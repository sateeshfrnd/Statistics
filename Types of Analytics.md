# Types of Analytics 

Analytics can be broadly categorized into four main types, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and decision-making:

1. **Descriptive Analytics**:
   - Descriptive analytics involves analyzing historical data to understand what happened in the past.
   - It focuses on summarizing and describing data to provide insights into patterns, trends, and relationships.
   - Descriptive analytics techniques include data visualization, summary statistics, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Example: Generating reports and dashboards to summarize sales performance over the past year.

2. **Diagnostic Analytics**:
   - Diagnostic analytics involves analyzing data to understand why certain events occurred.
   - It aims to identify the root causes of problems or anomalies observed in the data.
   - Diagnostic analytics techniques include regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and root cause analysis.
   - Example: Investigating factors contributing to a decrease in website traffic or customer churn.

3. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Predictive analytics involves analyzing historical data to make predictions about future events or outcomes.
   - It uses statistical models and machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends and behaviors.
   - Predictive analytics techniques include regression analysis, time series forecasting, and predictive modeling.
   - Example: Predicting future sales revenue based on historical sales data and market trends.

4. **Prescriptive Analytics**:
   - Prescriptive analytics involves analyzing data to recommend actions or decisions to achieve desired outcomes.
   - It combines insights from descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics to provide actionable recommendations.
   - Prescriptive analytics techniques include optimization models, simulation, and decision analysis.
   - Example: Recommending optimal pricing strategies to maximize profitability based on predictive models and market conditions.

These types of analytics are often used in combination to provide a comprehensive approach to data analysis and decision-making. Organizations leverage analytics to gain insights, improve processes, and drive strategic decision-making across various domains, including business, healthcare, finance, and marketing.
